Another BASIC</h1>
<p>This is yet another implementation of BASIC programming language and though I was strongly tempted to call it yaBASIC, I managed to resist the (timeworn) acronym joke. Instead, I went with another acronym, that may not be funny at all, but succeeds on another level: It tells the whole story.</p>
<p>This project is an improved version of TinyBasicPlus which, in turn, improves upon <a href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/TinyBasicPlus" title="source code repository">Tiny BASIC</a>. And although the word 'improved' is loosely used, keep in mind that this implementation has many differences from it's predecessors in almost every aspect. It features an enriched command set and the main parts of the program have been rewritten in a (hopefuylly) more clear manner. It's not-so-tiny anymore and the name nstBASIC sprang from exactly this realisation. Besides, keeping the word tiny in the name, helps denote the heritage of the code.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_2"></a>
More than an interpreter</h1>
<p>nstBASIC is written for an 8bit microcontroller, just like TinyBasicPlus, but the code has been expanded in many ways, refactored and spread across many files. You could rightly argue that making a larger version of an otherwise complete project, cannot be considered as an improvement. Nevertheless, such a claim, estranged from any reference to the purpose of the project, would be misleading.</p>
<p>TinyBasicPlus was developed for the Arduino platform and the user can interact with the language interpreter through a serial connection, using a terminal emulator on his computer. nstBASIC is something totally different! It is only meant to run on the specific hardware of a <a href="http://google.com" title="schematics and PCB">homemade computer</a>, which features a keyboard input, a sound card and a graphics card. Essentially, apart from being a language interpreter, nstBASIC acts as the BIOS of the aforementioned computer: It handles communication with the peripherals.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_3"></a>
(In)separable parts</h1>
<p>nstBASIC runs on the CPU of my homemade computer, which is not a real CPU. It's an ATMEGA644, that belogns to the family of 8bit AVRs. The specifics of this computer will be discussed in the documentation of the relevant project. For now, keep in mind that both the sound card and the graphics card are also implemented around 8bit microcontrollers. The main idea here, is that nstBASIC can be seen as a piece of firmware. It belongs to a set of programs that turn each microcontroller into a self-contained device. At the same time, these programs are designed to work together and along with some "glue logic" form a complete system. In other words, nstBASIC is an integral part of this computer.</p>
<p>Don't let the above description discourage you, if you wish to use the interpreter of BASIC in an entirely different project. The hardware dependent code is conveniently isolated from the interpreter code. All functions that are "tied" to the hardware reside in <code><a class="el" href="io_8c.html" title="Exchange data with sub-systems and peripherals. ">io.c</a></code>. Some other functions that you may have to tweak (or even get rid of), are those controlling the IO pins in <code>cmd_pinctl.c</code>. In most cases, in order to use the interpreter in a different hardware setup, you'll only have to hack those two files and a few constants in <a class="el" href="interpreter_8h.html" title="System specifications, global variables and function prototypes. ">interpreter.h</a> and <a class="el" href="printing_8h.html" title="Settings regardig printing and the necessary function prototypes. ">printing.h</a>. This convenient separation of functionality could be seen as a by-product of refactoring the interpreter, although in reality, it was a prerequisite. In TinyBasicPlus, the interpreter was implemented in a huge function and the control flow was achieved by the abundant use of goto command. The code was super-fast but almost impossible to study, extend or improve. In order to remedy this situation, I created a bundle of functions and a simple mechanism, that would allow the propagation of some signals &ndash; previously hosted in global variables. The first step to this direction was to group functions in different files, according to the purpose each one served...</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_4"></a>
License</h1>
<p>As described above, the main part of nstBASIC derived from the extensive modifications of TinyBasicPlus' core. The interpreter was practically written from scratch and the general structure of the code was altered significantly. There are some functions though, mainly those of the parser, which were only tweaked on a cosmetic level. The functions that handle communication with the rest of the hardware were written by me.</p>
<p>TinyBasicPlus is distributed under MIT license. The code I wrote, as well as the modified/extended interpreter, is distributed under the <a href="www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html" title="official license text">GPLv3 Licence</a>. The same applies for nstBASIC as a whole.</p>
